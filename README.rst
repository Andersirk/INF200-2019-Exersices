**Exersice 0:**

Before we start the exersices, you must prepare the exersice repository.
There are a number of files you should modify to do this.

 * Fill in the setup.py file (i.e. replace FIRSTNAME with your first name,
   SURNAME with your surname, and your@email.no with your email adress)
 * Fill in the setup.cfg file (i.e. replace FIRSTNAME with your first name,
   SURNAME with your surname, and your@email.no with your email adress)
 * Modify this file (i.e. replace FIRSTNAME with your first name and SURNAME
   with your surname)
 * Change the name of the YOUR_NAME_ex folder
   * Example: "yngve_moe_ex"
   * Note that there are no capital letters here.
